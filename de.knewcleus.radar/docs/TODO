- implement on-screen menus (display configuration, etc.)
- implement aircraft tag handling (moving the tag, etc.)
- when removing behaviours from the behaviour stack, make sure that behaviours depending on them
  are also removed
- basic physics model of thrust and lift/drag
- properly model atmosphere
- (re-)implement aircraft behaviours
	- basic:
		- bank control
		- turn rate control
		- heading control
		- pitch control
		- climb/descend rate control
		- altitude control
		- speed control
	- left/right 360
	- position reporting (overhead, abeam, established radial, established localizer, established glideslope)
	- traffic pattern
	- homing
	- holding
	- routing
	- visual approach
	- instrument approach
	- take-off
	- traffic avoidance
- implement missing map data
	- DME, ILS, NDB
	- approach and departure routes
	- airport layouts
	- airspace data
	- elevation data
	- water bodies
	- location names
- implement FlightGear multiplayer interface
- implement dynamic configuration for
	- token decomposers
	- aircraft types
	- aircraft behaviour
	- aircraft message handlers
	- map data sources
	- menu handlers
	- voice packs
- implement transponder handling
	- VFR aircraft show up with 7000 until identification
	- squawk ident
	- emergency codes
	- loss of signal/primary radar when transponder off/crashed
- implement collision warning
