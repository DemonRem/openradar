TARGET ARCHITECTURE
===================

NOTE: This is not the current architecture, but a target to work towards.

In general the architecture should model the architecture of actual radar and control systems.

(R1) There shall be a radar which provides radar targets with primary and secondary information
(position + transponder data).

(R2) This radar data is regularly updated in intervals of about 1 second.

(R3) There shall be a flightplan server providing flightplan data by flightnumber or callsign.

(R4) The flightplan data consists of the typical data provided in the normal ICAO flightplan forms:
	- Callsign/Flight Number
	- Flightrules
	- Type of flight
	- Number of aircraft
	- Aircraft type (ICAO)
	- Wake category
	- Navigation equipment
	- Aerodrome of departure
	- EOBT
	- Speed
	- Cruise Level
	- Route
	- Aerodrome of destination
	- ETE
	- Alternates 1 + 2
	- Remarks (parse and separate)

(R5) Coordination data shall be passed from sector to sector on coordination.

(R6) Coordination data shall consist of
	- Callsign/Flight Number
	- Assigned SSR-Code
	- (further data concerned in coordination as specified in EEC report 292)

(R7) Coordination is a multi-step process, in which multiple refinements of coordination data may occur until the transferring controller has released the aircraft and the next controller as assumed control over it.

(R8) The communication model shall support both structured messages (e.g. for AI aircraft) as well as simple text and voice messages.
