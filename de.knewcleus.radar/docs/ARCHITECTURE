TARGET ARCHITECTURE
===================

NOTE: This is not the current architecture, but a target to work towards.

In general the architecture should model the architecture of actual radar and control systems.

(Req-10) There shall be a radar which provides radar targets with primary and secondary information
(position + transponder data).

(Req-20) The radar display is updated whenever radar data updates are received.

(Req-30) There shall be a flightplan server providing flightplan data by flightnumber or callsign.

(Req-40) The flightplan data consists of the typical data provided in the normal ICAO flightplan forms:
	- Callsign/Flight Number
	- Flightrules, Type of flight
	- Number of aircraft, Aircraft type (ICAO), Wake category
	- Navigation equipment
	- Aerodrome of departure, EOBT
	- Speed, Cruise Level, Route
	- Aerodrome of destination, ELDT, Alternates
	- Remarks

(Req-50) Coordination data shall be passed from sector to sector on coordination.

(Req-60) Coordination is a multi-step process, in which multiple refinements of coordination data may occur until the transferring controller has released the aircraft and the next controller as assumed control over it.

(Req-70) The communication model shall support both structured messages (e.g. for AI aircraft) as well as simple text and voice messages.
